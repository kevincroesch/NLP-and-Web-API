Kevin Roesch’s NLP Model

Whether you know exactly what it is or not, you’ve heard of Reddit and the vast community it represents. Reddit’s slogan is that it’s “The Front Page of the Internet”. Regardless of what is peaking your interest at a given moment, Reddit has a collection of posts from like-minded individuals just like you. The challenge is that with such an endless ocean of topics, it can sometimes be difficult to identify the community is right for you. 

I get it, you love pizza AND chicken wings. You love baseball AND basketball. Maybe you love CrossFit AND running. However, you don’t have time to sort through everything Reddit has to offer and  find out which posts are for you. You need something that can take in multiple subreddit pages, sort through all the posts, and give you a detailed list of what is important to each of these communities. You’re a valuable person and your time is one of your most valuable assets. 

That’s where I come in. We have created a model to solve this for you. Simply identify which subreddit pages you’re interested in and our model will parse through thousands of posts, identify important or key words and phrases, and identiy which subreddit page a given post came. Along with the given post, our model is able provide a list for you of the most common words and phrases found in those posts. How is this helping you? By saving time. Our model is doing all of the work for you. Just specify which subreddit pages you’re interested in and BAM! You’re outfitted with all the information you have ever wanted.

Don’t believe me? We were able to run multiple variations of models and multiple subreddit pages to identify which subreddit certain posts came from with 99% accuracy. We can do this for YOU too.

Don’t hesitate. Save yourself the time now. Get involved with the Reddit community you have always dreamed of, and do so armed with the most information to make the BEST decision.
